- Hemodynamics
	- physical aspect blood circulation
	- include cardiac function, arterial and peripheral vascular system
- Cardiac Cycle
	- event occur in heart from begin of heartbeat to the next
	- number of cycle depends on HR
	- Three Major events
		- Diastole
		- Atrial Systole
		- Ventricular Systole 
- PUT picture of cardiac cycle
- Key Concepts
	- Stroke volume: preload, afterload, contractility
	- End diastolic volume:
	- End systolic volume:
	- Preload: stretching of the heart, blood is filling in, muscle fibers stretching
	- Afterload: blood is ejected into the body 
	- Contractility: Resistance that happens after 
- Sympathetic vs parasympathetic 
	- vagus nerve is stimulated everything goes down, decrease in HR 
	- Slow HR, tachy = beta blocker
- Replace what is being lost
	- if a fluid problem ask for fluids, if a blood problem give blood
- Heart does not contract well if BIG, CHF, cardiomyopathy 
- Measuring/Monitoring Hemodynamics
	- Invasive and noninvasive 
		- cap refill, BP, neuro assessment, pallor, temp, heart sounds, bounding/weak/normal pulse, lung sounds, VS
		- Pulse ox, EKG, fluid responsiveness, BP, enchocardiography
	- 45 degree angle lay pt flat, raise the knees for 1 minute 
	- Invasive
		- Intra-arterial BP, 
		- central venous pressure (CVP) can tell us if pt is overloaded or dehydrated fluid volume deficit 
		- want 2-6 cvp if over than 6 pt needs diuresis,  if less than 2 need fluid
		- pulmonary artery pressure (PAP): measures left side of heart, pulmonary heart area
			- what chf looking like, diagnose pulmonary HTN 
			- starts 
			- Sits right into the pulmonary artery
		- need to be specially trained 
- KNOW CVP RANGE 
- KNOW MAP: 65-100 normal
- dont need PCWP 
- looking at the cap refill when taking arterial blood pressure
	- can become ischemic or necrotic easily 
	- pt may complain of nerve pain because is right against the nerve
- Reading arterial BP
	- dont have to read or know specifically, if in the ICU ask to see and ask nurse to explain
- Arterial (more accurate) & non-invasive BP
	- compare once a shift, or if changes with pt 
	- readings are different
	- pressure vs volume
	- NIBP<ABP
	- MAP is always best correlation
- Nursing Intervention Interpretation: 
	- infection control/prevent
		- hand hygiene
		- dressing
		- catheter site
		- needleless catheter systems 
		- bathing
		- pt edu
		- chapter 21 table 21-5 CDC guidelines
		- care bundles
		- lines should not be in for more than 7 days (arterial BP) if doc decides not to pull out  should document
		- monitor air embolism 
- Coronary Atherosclerosis 
	- silent heart attacks: pt does not recall
	- patho atherosclerosis
		- build of lipids
		- narrowing of artery stable/unstable can change anytime 
	- Labs 
		- pTT, INR, CBC factor 10A
	- Myocardial ischemia 
		- inadequate blood flow
	- Angina pectoris
		- chest pain
	- MI
		- decrease in blood supply great or long enough that cause irreversible damage to the heart or specific area of the heart
		-MI can progress into Heart failure cardiac arrest
	-Modifiable risk factors
		-diet, exercise, smoking, weight, HTN, cholesterol levels, 
	-muscle weakness joint pain, liver failure= HIGH doses of statin should educated patients
	-Repatha: helps prevent MI, have a familial gene/hx 
	- What is metabolic syndrome
		- 3/5
			- elevated triglycerides greater than equal to 175
			- reduced HDL less than 40 in men less than 50 in females
			- are currently in treatment to reduce HDL
			- elevated fasting glucose greater than or equal to 100 on two separate occasions 
	- high sensitivity c-reactive protein: CRP is measured how bad inflammation is, 

Prevention of CAD: 

Cholesterol Meds:

Angina pectoris: has to do with physical activity or lack of
	- pressure in chest caused by lack of blood flow 
	- stable, predictable, consistent, relieved by rest or nitroglycerin 
		- nitro: worst case headache of life symptom
	- unstable angina: may or may not be relieved by rest or nitro
		- no pattern comes and go, increases in frequency and severity 
	- silent ischemia: changes on EKG, pt may not report of any pain 
- Assessment
	- ask pain feel like, describe
	- nauseous, abdominal pain, anxious, SOB, dizzy, vomiting 
	- women experience symptoms more different than men, fatigue, anxious, vomiting, nauseous, abd pain
	- men: back pain, ect. 
- gerontological considerations angina: 
	- more confused than normal, silent CAD, weak, my present with signs of UTI, pharmacological stress test, use medications cautiously than adult can overdosed (e.g digoxin)
-treatment: 
	- rest and oxygen Morphine Oxygen Nitro Aspirin (MONA) according to book treatment for angina pectoris 
*********Only test whats in the book**********


Medications for angina
-nitro: sl, iv, nasal spray, spray in mouth
-beta blocker: metoprolol
-O2 2-4 liters
-antiplatelet: aspirin what go home on, heparin, lovenox
-no invasive procedures while pt is on heparin
	-short half life
	-monitor PTT INR


Assessment of pt with angina pectoris: 
-pt and family knowledge 

Goals: SMART goals 
-immediate and appropriate treatment of angina 
-Prevention of angina
-aware of disease process
-understanding of prescribed care and adherence to the self-care program
-absence of complication
