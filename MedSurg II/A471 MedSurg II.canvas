Non-thienopyridines (also P2Y2RIs) like cangrelor & ticagrelor are used as well.  These work differently than aspirin and provide dual antiplatelet blockade.  Give with ASA                                                                                                       |\n| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| H   | Heparin: (low cost and reversible anticoagulant) Unfractionated Heparin is still the gold standard drug.  LMW heparins such as enoxaparin are also used as they are more specific towards factor Xa, but they are longer acting and may cause a problem with those needing surgery                                                                                                                  |\n| R   | Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Blockade: (Slows Ventricular remodeling after acute MI) Ventricular dilation in response to cardiac injury.  Use ACEi (enalapril, lisinopril) or ARB (losartan, olmesartan or valsartan)                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| O   | Oxygen: (Improves oxygenation to deprived tissues) The intent of this is to saturate injured tissue with oxygen rich blood to decrease the size of infarcted myocardium and tissue injury. HOWEVER, hyperoxygenation in patients that aren't hypoxemic can cause vasoconstriction and increase the risk of additional MI. If they don't need it, don't give it.                                     |\n| M   | Morphine: (Used for pain control and relief of symptoms) This drug is the drug of choice for pain reduction in the setting of ACS. It also decreases oxygen demand on the myocardium, decreases blood pressure and lower heart rate by increasing vagal tone.                                                                                                                                       |\n| B   | Beta Blockers: (To reduce heart rate and myocardial 0, consumption) Start BB (carvedilol, metoprolol, propranolol) within 24 hours of MI. This has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with dx of acute MI. DO NOT USE in patients with heart failure, shock or heart block (2nd or 3rd degree without pacemaker, with asthma or reactive airway disease) or with PR interval '0.24 seconds. |\n| I   | Invasive Cardiac Interventions: (Revascularization) Such as: Coronary angioplasty, Stent placement, Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), pacemaker, defibrillator, heart valve surgery, etc. Refer these patients quickly for prompt intervention BEFORE irreversible damage or death occurs.                                                                                                       |\n| N   | Nitro: (Venodilator) This decreases venous return to the heart, which then decreases left ventricular workload and myocardial oxygen demand. Concurrently, the coronary artery dilation also helps deliver oxygen to ischemic areas of the heart muscle. HOWEVER, nitrates have not proven to show much effect on mortality.                                                                        |\n| S   | Statin: (High intensity statin age 75 & under, Moderate intensity Statin 75 & up with CAD) Statins hinder the hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, which is an enzyme necessary for cholesterol production.  Takes 2 years to see the long-term benefit & reduces the risk of death by 25% at that point.  Aspirin (mainstay) reduces death at STEMI by 23%                                 |\n","x":-520,"y":-300,"width":940,"height":720}
